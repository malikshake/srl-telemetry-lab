# Nokia SR Linux Streaming Telemetry Lab

SR Linux has first-class Streaming Telemetry support thanks to [100% YANG coverage](https://learn.srlinux.dev/yang/) of state and config data. The holistic coverage enables SR Linux users to stream **any** data off of the NOS with on-change, sample, or target-defined support. A discrepancy in visibility across APIs is not about SR Linux.

This lab represents a small Clos fabric with [Nokia SR Linux](https://learn.srlinux.dev/) switches running as containers. The lab topology consists of a Clos topology, plus a Streaming Telemetry stack comprised of [gnmic](https://gnmic.openconfig.net), [pktvisor](https://github.com/orb-community/pktvisor), [Grafana Alloy](https://grafana.com/oss/alloy-opentelemetry-collector/) and [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/features/).

In addition to the telemetry stack, the lab also includes a modern logging stack comprised of [promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) and [loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/).

Goals of this lab:

1. Demonstrate how a telemetry stack can be incorporated into the containerlab topology file.
2. Explain SR Linux holistic telemetry support.
3. Provide practical configuration examples for the gnmic collector, pktvisor, and Grafana Alloy to subscribe to fabric nodes and export metrics and logs to Grafana Cloud.

## Deploying the lab

The lab is deployed with the [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev) project, where [`st.clab.yml`](st.clab.yml) file declaratively describes the lab topology.

```bash
# change into the cloned directory
# and execute
./start_containerlab.sh
```

To remove the lab:

```bash
containerlab destroy --cleanup
```

## Accessing the network elements

Once the lab has been deployed, the different SR Linux nodes can be accessed via SSH through their management IP address, given in the summary displayed after the execution of the deploy command. It is also possible to reach those nodes directly via their hostname, defined in the topology file. Linux clients cannot be reached via SSH, as it is not enabled, but it is possible to connect to them with a docker exec command.

```bash
# reach a SR Linux leaf or a spine via SSH
ssh admin@leaf1
ssh admin@spine1

# reach a Linux client via Docker
docker exec -it client1 bash
```

## Fabric configuration

The DC fabric used in this lab consists of three leaves and two spines interconnected as shown in the diagram.

Leaves and spines use Nokia SR Linux IXR-D2 and IXR-D3L chassis respectively. Each network element of this topology is equipped with a [startup configuration file](configs/fabric/) that is applied at the node's startup.

Once booted, network nodes will come up with interfaces, underlay protocols and overlay service configured. The fabric is running Layer 2 EVPN service between the leaves.

### Verifying the underlay and overlay status

The underlay network runs eBGP, while iBGP is used for the overlay network. The Layer 2 EVPN service is configured as explained in this comprehensive tutorial: [L2EVPN on Nokia SR Linux](https://learn.srlinux.dev/tutorials/l2evpn/intro/).

By connecting via SSH to one of the leaves, we can verify the status of those BGP sessions.

```

## Traffic generation

When the lab is started, there is not traffic running between the nodes as the clients are sending any data. To run traffic between the nodes, leverage `traffic.sh` control script.

To start the traffic:

* `bash traffic.sh start all` - start traffic between all nodes
* `bash traffic.sh start 1-2` - start traffic between client1 and client2
* `bash traffic.sh start 1-3` - start traffic between client1 and client3

To stop the traffic:

* `bash traffic.sh stop` - stop traffic generation between all nodes
* `bash traffic.sh stop 1-2` - stop traffic generation between client1 and client2
* `bash traffic.sh stop 1-3` - stop traffic generation between client1 and client3

As a result, the traffic will be generated between the clients and the traffic rate will be reflected on the grafana dashboard.
